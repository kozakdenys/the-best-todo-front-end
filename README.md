This project is created as a playground for me.
It contains setup for really hipster's stuck: Vue, TypeScript, webpack, eslint, prettier, jest, etc.
Other parts of the app:
- Back End https://github.com/kozakdenys/the-best-todo-docker
- Docker scripts https://github.com/kozakdenys/the-best-todo-docker
